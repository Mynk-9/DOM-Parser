# DOM-Parser
 A small DOM(Document Object Model) Parsing library. C++17 is preferred.
  
Current capabilities:
 1) Scan markup code.
 2) Store the markup data in a tree structure.
 3) Storage of the data is optimized in terms of space and time complexity for fast manipulations like moving whole subtrees and multiple deletions-additions of nodes/attributes. 
 4) Provide minfied or pretty-printed output.

Needed work:
  1) Currently it is not resilient to syntax errors.
